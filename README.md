Title:Purchase Prediction Using Decision Trees

This is a machine learning project that utilizes decision trees to predict whether a customer will make a purchase or not. Decision trees are a popular choice for classification tasks and are particularly useful when you want to understand and interpret the decision-making process of the model.

Predicting customer purchase behavior is essential for businesses to optimize their marketing and sales strategies. Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks. In this project, we have implemented a decision tree model to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on various customer attributes and historical data.
